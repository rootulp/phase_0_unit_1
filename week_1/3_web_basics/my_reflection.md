1. I learned the difference between the web and the internet.
    I also learned about DNS or the Domain Name System.
2. I noticed indenting is pretty important. I tried copy and pasting the content "<html>..." from the github repo but everything was placed on one line. It was pretty easy to notice that code that's written compact and on one line like that is much more difficult to read than properly formated and tabbed code.
3. I was excited! Although it did take a while for the site to go live (*Something I think is worth mentioning to other students)
4. An "aha" moment was when I learned about GitHub Pages and the fact that GitHub makes it really easy to quickly edit sites on the fly.
5. Nope.
