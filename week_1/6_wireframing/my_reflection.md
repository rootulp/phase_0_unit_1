1. I enjoyed drawing the wireframe. I found wireframing tools online to look pretty tedious and boring though.
2. No real questions besides the disorganized nature of the assignment. I didn't like how I had to jump to a later assignment to understand what to do here.
3. Some what confident.
4. I enjoyed building my wireframe_sites page.
5. Drawing 3 different wireframes. I would've focused more if we only had to do two.
