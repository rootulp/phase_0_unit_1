1. Tags make sense to me. I don't like how syntax is kind of clunky and more difficult to write than basic Ruby. Regardless buidling a simple website was fairly easy. I think it'll be much more confusing to build sites worth using and looking at though.
2. Good: Easy to pick up. Bad: Hard to write quickly or understand quickly.
3. The concept of Classes and IDs for CSS were soldified. 
4. Looking at Bootstrap's CSS files were really helpful.
