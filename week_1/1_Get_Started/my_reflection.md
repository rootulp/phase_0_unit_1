## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1. I already had git and GitHub set up. 
2. Git is a version control software that was originally developed by Linus Torvalds (the guy behind Linux). Git is kind of like google docs for coding. Git allows you to track changes made to your document. On the other hand, GitHub is a program that lives on the interenet and can sync your changes to the cloud. GitHub also makes it easy to work with peers on the same piece of code. GitHub is kind of like Dropbox for files... two people can edit the same file and sync changes across the internet.
3. Answered above.
4. Developers use git or other version control software because it essentially provides insurance when something goes wrong. Version control software is necessary in trial and error programming because having various copies of the stages of your code can help you learn and work more effectively. Instead of restarting everytime you run into an error, one can revert back to a previous version of working code. This makes sense to me.
5. Version control software makes sense to me. 
6. Question - Is there any advantage to using the terminal to perform git commands "git commit or git init" as opposed to using the native GUI GitHub supplies. So far, I feel comfortable using the GUI but haven't fully learned / memorize all possible terminal git commands.
