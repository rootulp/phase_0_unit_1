## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. Use github.com -> click the "+" symbole in the top right -> Add a repo -> Walk through the steps.
    Once your repo has been created, open up the github app on your machine and find your repo. Click "clone to computer"
2. Open Source Software is software that has open and accesible code. This means that people are given the permision to see, copy, and edit the code that was used to create a program. Open Source Software is pretty important because it allows people the oppurtunity to learn from other people's work, as well as create free programs that are alternatives to more pricey software.
3. Licensing grants specific permissions for other people to use your work (taken from smashing magazine). 
4. Didn't struggle with much but the information on licensing was new. I thought the explanation of the MIT licence was particularly interesting because I didn't realize how lax licencing could be.
