## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I'm very confused by this assignment. I don't understand how it differs from our wireframe_sites assignment. It seemed to me like we were supposed to discuss the design of website in that assignment so I copied the code from that file into a new file called week1_technical_blog. I'm sprucing up the page to make it look better but I'm still confused as to how they differ.
