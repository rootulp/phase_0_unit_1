# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
    The DOM is a tree structure of the html on a page. It seems easy to navigate but I don't understand how different is from the HTML.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
    wordpress sites are much more complex. They have a ton of javascript style files and are much more organized.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
    Fun and useful but the codeschool page broke on me and I had a tough time completing the course because I couldn't load the page correctly.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
    I learned a lot messing around with the chrome dev tools.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
    Mostly used the sources listed.
