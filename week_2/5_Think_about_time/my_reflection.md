# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

1. Getting finals studying (for school) done while keeping up with Phase 0 prep.
2. Working on DBC stuff during the breaks I take from school work.
3. I already use somewhat of a pomodoro technique in my usual work flow.
4. Finishing Phase 0 in time!
