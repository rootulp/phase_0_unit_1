# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. Web standards make sense.
2. I like the html5 elements more than pre-html5 elements because it seems easier to read and style.
3. reset.css is necessary because some basic html elements have default styling and reset.css get's rid of this default styling so your page can look the same on seveal browsers.
4. Chrome and Firefox. I haven't noticed a huge difference but I'm assuming that's because I never use Internet Explorer.
5. Nope.
