Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I enjoyed working on design. I don't think I have a particularly good eye for design though. 
2. In all honesty, my process was messing around with bootstrap css and trying to implement a design that looked decent.
3. Add a link to a blog site. Also implement icons for the github, facebook, twitter, and email links.
4. Twitter's Bootstrap.
