    <h1>How to Pair Program</h1>
 </div>
 <div id="main">
   <p id="def">Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which
   two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes
   code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator, reviews each
   line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
  While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the 
  work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address.
  This frees the driver to focus all of his or her attention on the "tactical" aspects
  of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.</p>
