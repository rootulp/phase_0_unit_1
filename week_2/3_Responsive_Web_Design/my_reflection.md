# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is the act of making websites respond to the context (especially the width and height) of the screen they are viewed on. I really like responsive web design. It makes sites easy to navigate on all types of screens (laptops, tablets, phones, etc.). I think it's good practice.
2. I think new technology, especially new screen sizes will force more and more websites to be responsive.
3. Yes we should. I would imagine that visually impaired people need to use color contrast tools and magnification to percieve websites.
4. Makes sites fluid or adaptive rather than responsive.
5. No but I did the treehouse course and it was pretty informative.
